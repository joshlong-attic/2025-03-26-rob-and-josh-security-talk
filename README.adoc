Hi, Spring fans! In which the heroes secure the way.

For the configuration, https://github.com/coffee-software-show/bootiful-grpc-config.git[see this repo]





== where we are (rob + his trusty sidekick josh)

- introduce authentication in the abstract (call it `auth`)
	- start.spring.io
	- jdbc, postgresql, web, authorization server, security, dev tools , testcontainers
	- go to test main method, add `@RestartScope`
	- security 101 + spring security 101 (authentication, authorization)
	- introduce UserDetailsService for user management
	- great but this is a password and its in memory
	- ok switch to SQL DB with noop / sha pw
	- add `schema.sql` and `data.sql`
	- run SQL migration
		- but how do we migrate if we are using testcontainers/
		- docker ps and check mapped port for `5432`
		-
	- PasswordEncoderFactories.*
	- it works
	- password migration
	- JDBC + UserDetailsManger
	- one time tokens/magic links
	- passkeys + webauthn
	- this is great but its only one service, lets centralize
	- turn into a Spring Auth Server
- stand up a trivial service resource server
	- `hello, rwinch!`
- stand up a client  (oauth client)
	- RestClient + token manually
	- RestClient + autoconfig
	- proxy with Spring Cloud Gateway + Oauth client
	- `/api/**` → `resource`
	- `/**` → CDN with vue app
