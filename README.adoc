Hi, Spring fans! In which the heroes secure the way.

For the configuration, https://github.com/coffee-software-show/bootiful-grpc-config.git[see this repo]

== where we are (rob + his trusty sidekick josh)
- both: intros

- introduce authentication in the abstract (call it `auth`)
	- start.spring.io
	- jdbc, postgresql, web, authorization server, security, devtools , testcontainers
	- go to test main method, add `@RestartScope`
	- RW: security 101 + spring security 101 (authentication, authorization)
	- introduce in-memory `UserDetailsService` for user management
	- `PasswordEncoderFactories` to encode passwords
	- great but this is a password and its in memory
	- add `schema.sql` and `data.sql`
	- rename `application.properties` to `application.yml`
	- run SQL migration
	    - copy `data.sql` and `schema.sql` to `auth/src/main/resources`
		- add `sql.init.mode=always` to `application.yml`
	- inspect SQL DB and verify passwords are sha prefixed: run `bin/db.sh` to login to DB
	- login
	- inspect SQL DB again and verify passwords are bcrypt
	- password migration
	- JDBC + `JdbcUserDetailsManager` + `UserDetailsPasswordService` (which injects `JdbcUserDetailsManager`)
	- passkeys: josh does code but no idea where to go after
	- passkeys + webauthn: `http://localhost:8080`
	- RL: walk josh through registering and using a passkey via iPhone / separate device
	- RL: explanation of the details
	- alternatively, sometimes u may just want a slightly easier-to-ensure alternative factor. Enter OTT.
	- one time tokens/magic links: use `localhost:8080`: `login/ott?token=...`
	- this is great but its only one service, lets centralize. maybe OAuth
	- RW: OAuth for fun and profit!
	- turn into a Spring Auth Server
- stand up a trivial service resource server
	- `hello, rwinch!`
- stand up a client  (oauth client)
	- RestClient + token manually
	- RestClient + autoconfig
	- proxy with Spring Cloud Gateway + Oauth client
	- `/api/**` → `resource`
	- `/**` → CDN with vue app

== ++ (rob)
- Testjars
- Lots of moving parts require a detailed README, but we saw testcontainers can help for database, but what about our apps
- testcontainers simple for authz and service
- testcontainers for the real authz and service
	
= - method security
